Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Implementation for MNIST. 

This project demonstrates a PyTorch-based implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic MNIST-like images. The code includes the creation and testing of generator and discriminator models, loss functions, and the training loop.

Features
1. Generator
The generator creates fake MNIST-like images using a noise vector as input.

Key Components:
Fully connected layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation.
Final layer with a sigmoid activation for output image generation.
Defined Classes and Functions:
get_generator_block(input_dim, output_dim)
Generator(z_dim, im_dim, hidden_dim)
2. Discriminator
The discriminator classifies whether an image is real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).

Key Components:
Fully connected layers with LeakyReLU activation.
Final linear layer for real/fake prediction.
Defined Classes and Functions:
get_discriminator_block(input_dim, output_dim)
Discriminator(im_dim, hidden_dim)
3. Loss Functions
Custom functions for generator and discriminator losses using Binary Cross Entropy Loss:

get_gen_loss for generator loss.
get_disc_loss for discriminator loss.
4. Noise Generation
Function get_noise generates random noise vectors as input for the generator.

5. Training Loop
The code includes a comprehensive training loop:

Updates discriminator and generator weights.
Tracks and displays generator and discriminator losses.
Visualizes real and generated images at regular intervals.
Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
PyTorch 1.7.0 or higher
torchvision
tqdm
matplotlib
Install dependencies with:

bash
Copiar código
pip install torch torchvision tqdm matplotlib
How to Run
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Install the required libraries.
Execute the script:
bash
Copiar código
python gan_mnist.py
The model will train on the MNIST dataset, and generated images will be displayed periodically.
Output
During training:

Losses for both generator and discriminator are logged.
Generated and real MNIST images are visualized in a grid.
Notes
The generator's noise vector size (z_dim) and other parameters like learning rate and number of epochs can be adjusted for experimentation.
The script has built-in tests to validate model blocks and functions. Ensure these tests pass for proper functionality.
